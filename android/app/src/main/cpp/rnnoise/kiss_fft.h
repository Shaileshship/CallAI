 ATTENTION!
 If you would like a :
 -- a utility that will handle the caching of fft objects
 -- real-only (no imaginary time component ) FFT
 -- a multi-dimensional FFT
 -- a command-line utility to perform ffts
 -- a command-line utility to find fft prime factors
 -- a library that checks the accuracy of the fft against libfftw3
